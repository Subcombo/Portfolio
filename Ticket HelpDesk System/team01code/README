### What is what?

- All of the FLOSS libraries we are using are accompanied by their licenses.
- call_elements/ contains reusable PHP files for various features of this software,
  like supporting equipment tables, similar solution box, and so on (despite the
  name these are not only used in call.php, however the name has been left unchanged
  for legacy reasons)
  - Note for SEARCH_WIDGET:
    to use it you need to implement to functions in javascript:
      - override_get_url_for(call_id, selected_ticket) which should return
        a url that will be navigated to upon pressing a result
      - fill_category_and_specialist_for_search({ 'category' : x, 'specialist_id' : y })
        where x is a category selection (viz. PHP-DB/api.php) and y is spec user id

- localisation/ contains localisation files
- login-toolkit/ contains login related, session management files
- PHP-API/ contains various helper scripts in PHP relating to mainly AJAX
- PHP-DB/ contains api.php, a file of functions binding our project to the SQL DB
- PHP-Reusables/ contains PHP files included in all of the project pages,
  these files ensure that all of the files needed in HTML are included,
  and all the common libraries are loaded
    - navbar.php: contains the top bootstrap bar.
      What is important is that if we want to show the page title in the bar
      we have to set $PAGE_TITLE variable
    - header.php: script and style inclusions

- call.php: allows the operator to manage the call and its tickets
- employee_directory.php: summary of all employees registered in the DB
- forgotten_pass.php: PHP script and website allowing the user request an email
  with the link to reset their password
- home.php: operators' home page
- index.php: redirects to login.php
- make_call.php: script that is invoked when the call needs to be created
- open_tickets.php: lists of all the tickets (not necessarily open, however allows to check)
- reset_password.php: PHP script and website allowing the user to reset their password
- reset_token.php: a script and page where the user can actually reset their password,
  provided they hold a valid reset link
- specialist_home.php: specialists' home page
- stats.php: displays statistics
- ticket.php: displays ticket details (outside the call)
